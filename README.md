Use this small node module to get updated Vietnam Dong exchange rates from Vietcombank. Currently, it only supports fetching data from Vietcombank and provides the exchange rates with the most common foreign currency in Vietnam. Suggestions and feature requests are welcome.

Look at test cases for code samples. The only thing to note is that all functions return promises, which you can see its usage as in the test cases.
